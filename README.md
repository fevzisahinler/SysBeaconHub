# SysBeaconHub
This middleware, written in Go, captures data that is subscribed to the RabbitMQ queue and writes it to InfluxDB, enabling data integration. The middleware is designed to orchestrate the data flow and route data from RabbitMQ to InfluxDB quickly and reliably. The project was developed to meet the requirements of data processing and analysis.
